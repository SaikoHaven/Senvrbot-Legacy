# <h1>Senvrbot Legacy</h1>
Senvr's Discord bot written in Python via discord.py
NOTE: You will need to enter your own discord bot token in. I assume you know how to do that. (It's the TOKEN variable)
This is not my bot, I am just making modifications. Senvr owns this project and you should check him out. Also he's my friend so I might be a little biased- This is to maintain the old one as it's read-only. This is obsolete and you should check out Senvrbot 2 or whatever the hell he calls it.
