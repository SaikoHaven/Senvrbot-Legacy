# Senvrbot
My Discord bot written in Python via discord.py
NOTE: You will need to enter your own discord bot token in. I assume you know how to do that.
## Quotes.txt
Quotes are read from `quotes.txt` found in the root path

## Audio/
Audio is read from the directory listing of the `audio` directory, a random track in said directory is played 

## install.sh
A shell script that installs the required dependancies. Tested and works on Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 9. Should work on a raspberry pi or something but I'm not 100% on that
## startup.sh
Shell script that starts the application in a screen session. You can start the bot directly via `python3 main.py`.
